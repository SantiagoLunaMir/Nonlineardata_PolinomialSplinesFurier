This notebook demonstrates how to measure the error from different approaches to understanding non-linear data. Various methods exist for calculating, predicting, and, most importantly, finding the model closest to the ground truth. This "ground truth" refers to data that has been processed and compared to verify its accuracy, or at least represents the best available representation.
